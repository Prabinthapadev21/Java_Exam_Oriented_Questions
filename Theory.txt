What is Continue Statement in java?
Continue statement is a control flow statement which is used to skip the current iteration
of a loop and move to next one.It is often used with the conditional satements inside
for,while,do-while loop.
Example:
for(int i =0;i<10;i++)
{
if(i==5)
{
continue;
}
System.out.Println(i+"");
}
output = 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9

What is a partmeterized constructor? Explain With Example.
A parameterized constructor is a constructor that accepts arguments to initilize an object with specific values when it is created.
Example:
class Hello
{
String s;
}
public Hello(String s)
{
this.s = s;
}
public void display()
{
System.out.println("Name= "+s);
}
public static void main(String[] args)
{
Hello h = new Hello("Prabin");
h.display();
}
}

Explain Method Overloading in java with a proper example.
Method overloading is a feature in java where multiple methods can have same name
but the order,type and number should be different.
Example:
class Calculation
{
    public int  addition(int a,int b,int c)
    {
        return a+b+c;
    }
    public int  addition(int a,int b)
    {
        return a+b;
    }
}
public class MethodOverloadingConcept {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculation c = new Calculation();
        System.out.println("Sum = "+ c.addition(1,2,3));
        System.out.println("Sum ="+ c.addition(1,2));
    }
}

What is the use of this and super keyword.Explain with example.
this is a keyword in java which is  used to refer to instance variable methods or constructor with in the same class.
And super is also a keyword in java which is used to refer to instance variable, methods or constructor form the parent(super class) class
Example:
class Animal
{
    String name="Animal";
    void display()
    {
        System.out.println("I am a Animal");
    }
}
class Dog extends Animal
{
    String name ="Dog";
    void ShowNames()
    {
        System.out.println("Child class name:"+this.name);
        System.out.println("Parent class name:"+super.name);
    }
    void display()
    {
        super.display();
        System.out.println("I am a dog");
    }
}
public class ThisSuperKeywordExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog d = new Dog();
        d.ShowNames();
        d.display();
    }
}

Define Exceptions.How Exceptions are handeled in java? Explain with a proper example.
An exception in java is an unwanted event or error that occurs during the execution
of the program,which disrupts the normal flow of the program.
Exception are objects which represent runtime errors, such as dividing by zero,
accessing an invalid array index, or opening a file that doesnot exist.
We can handle exceptions through following keywords:try,catch,throw,throws.

Example:
public class ExceptionDemo
{
public static void main(String[] args)
{
try{
int i=0,num=2;
int div = num/i;
System.out.println("THis line will not execute");
}
catch(Exception e)
{
System.out.println("Exception caught!");
e.printStackTrace();
}
}
}

Write short note on:
An interface in java is a reference type,similar to class, that can contain only abstract methods(by default)
and constants(public,static, and final).It is used to achieve multiple inheritence in java, which is not possible
with classes alone.A class can implement multiple interface,allowing it to inherit behaviour from more than one source.
Interface define what a class must do,but not how it does it.
Example:
interface Printable{
void print();
}
interface Showable
{
void show();
}
class Demo implements Printable,Showable{
public void print()
{
System.out.println("Printing");
}
public void show()
{
System.out.println("Showing");
}
}
