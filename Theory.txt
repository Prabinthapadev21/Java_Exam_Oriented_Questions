What is Continue Statement in java?
Continue statement is a control flow statement which is used to skip the current iteration
of a loop and move to next one.It is often used with the conditional satements inside
for,while,do-while loop.
Example:
for(int i =0;i<10;i++)
{
if(i==5)
{
continue;
}
System.out.Println(i+"");
}
output = 0,1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9

What is a partmeterized constructor? Explain With Example.
A parameterized constructor is a constructor that accepts arguments to initilize an object with specific values when it is created.
Example:
class Hello
{
String s;
}
public Hello(String s)
{
this.s = s;
}
public void display()
{
System.out.println("Name= "+s);
}
public static void main(String[] args)
{
Hello h = new Hello("Prabin");
h.display();
}
}

Explain Method Overloading in java with a proper example.
Method overloading is a feature in java where multiple methods can have same name
but the order,type and number should be different.
Example:
class Calculation
{
    public int  addition(int a,int b,int c)
    {
        return a+b+c;
    }
    public int  addition(int a,int b)
    {
        return a+b;
    }
}
public class MethodOverloadingConcept {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculation c = new Calculation();
        System.out.println("Sum = "+ c.addition(1,2,3));
        System.out.println("Sum ="+ c.addition(1,2));
    }
}
